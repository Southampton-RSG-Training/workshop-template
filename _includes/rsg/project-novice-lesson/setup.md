## Project Management Setup

Before we get started, there are a few requirements to meet. You will need:

* [A GitHub account](https://github.com), with ssh key access.
* A GitHub repository titled `climate-analysis` (created in our **Version Control with Git** training).
* A code editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Getting the Demo Repository

If you haven't done our **Version Control with Git** training and don't have a `climate-analysis` repository, you can import a copy of it that's up-to-date.

[Go to GitHub](https://github.com) and from the **+** icon on the top bar select **Import Repository** (or [go directly to it here](https://github.com/new/import)):

Then, provide the demo repository [https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/project-novice](https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/project-novice) into the **Old Repository's Clone URL** field, and give it a name - e.g. `climate-analysis` or `project-novice-climate-analysis`, and click **Begin Import**:

Once you've begun the import process, it'll complete in anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes; then you can click the link to go straight to your new copy:
