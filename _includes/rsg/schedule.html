     <h3>
      Automating Tasks with the Unix Shell
     </h3>
    </a>
    <p>
     The Bash shell has been around longer than many of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it's a
  power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes.

  More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so that they don't
  have to type the same things over and over again.

  Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including
  "high-performance computing" supercomputers, like IRIDIS at the University of Southampton). These lessons will start
  you on a path towards using these resources effectively.

      Version Control with git
     </h3>
    </a>
    <p>
     Automated Version Control is a process for tracking changes to files and folders within a 'repository'.
  This workshop will teach you how to use the Git version control system to manage your code, tracking changes to files,
  inspecting and merging multiple different changes, and how to collaborate with other Git users using the GitHub online
  respository store.

     <h3>
      Building Programs with Python
     </h3>
    </a>
    <p>
     The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task: data analysis.

  Our real goal isn’t just to teach you Python, but to teach you the basic concepts that all programming depends on. We use Python in our lessons because:

  1. we have to use *something* for examples;
  2. it’s free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere;
  3. it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists; and
  4. experience shows that it’s easier for novices to pick up than most other languages.

  But the two most important things are to use whatever language your colleagues are using, so that you can share your work with them easily, and to use that language well.
