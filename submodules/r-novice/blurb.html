  This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
  experience. These lessons will be taught over three days. They start with
  some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through
  how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors,
  how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a
  data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting.
