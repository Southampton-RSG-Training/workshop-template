This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming
experience. These lessons will be taught over three days. They start with
some basic information about R syntax, the RStudio interface, and move through
how to import CSV files, the structure of data frames, how to deal with factors,
how to add/remove rows and columns, how to calculate summary statistics from a
data frame, and a brief introduction to plotting.

## Days

1. [Day1](_episodes/00-day-1.md)
2. [Day2](_episodes/00-day-2.md)
3. [Day3](_episodes/00-day-3.md)

## Requirements

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.  *These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but
working through this lesson requires working copies of the software described
below.  To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to download
the data and install everything *before* working through this lesson.

### Data

Data files for the lesson are available and can be downloaded manually here: <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459>

However, we will download them directly from R during the lessons when we need
them.
