## Python Setup ##

IDEs: PyCharm, Spyder, VS Code

We use Python 3*. The “Anaconda3” package provides everything Python-related you will need for the workshop. To install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), follow the instructions below.

Some old research projects may be in Python 2 but Python 2 has been retired and new projects should be in Python 3.

### Windows
Download the latest Anaconda Windows installer. Double-click the installer and follow the instructions. When asked “Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable”, answer “yes”. After it’s finished, close and reopen any open terminals to reload the updated PATH and allow the installed Python to be found.

### Mac OS X
Download the latest Anaconda Mac OS X installer. Double-click the .pkg file and follow the instructions.

### Linux
Download the latest Anaconda Linux Installer. Install via the terminal like this,

~~~
$ bash Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Answer ‘yes’ to allow the installer to initialize Anaconda3 in your .bashrc.
