Fist we need to reload the surveys data frame.

``` r
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

## Factors

When we did `str(surveys)` we saw that several of the columns consist of
integers.

Please note the default behavior of R has changed recently with the
release of 4.0.0
\[<https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2020/000653.html>\].

If using R version 3.\*.\*: The columns `genus`, `species`, `sex`,
`plot_type`, … however, are of a special class called `factor`.

If using R version 4.\*.\*: The columns `genus`, `species`, `sex`,
`plot_type`, … are strings\! The behavior was changed so
`stringsAsFactors = FALSE` is the default. So we are all working with
the same data types please reload the data using the following:

``` r
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Factors are very useful and actually contribute to making R particularly
well suited to working with data. So we are going to spend a little time
introducing them.

Factors represent categorical data. They are stored as integers
associated with labels and they can be ordered or unordered. While
factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are
actually treated as integer vectors by R. So you need to be very careful
when treating them as strings.

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values,
known as *levels*. By default, R always sorts levels in alphabetical
order. For instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:

``` r
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
```

R will assign `1` to the level `"female"` and `2` to the level `"male"`
(because `f` comes before `m`, even though the first element in this
vector is `"male"`). You can see this by using the function `levels()`
and you can find the number of levels using `nlevels()`:

``` r
levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)
```

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you
might want to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., “low”,
“medium”, “high”), it improves your visualization, or it is required
by a particular type of analysis. Here, one way to reorder our levels in
the `sex` vector would be:

``` r
sex # current order
```

    > [1] male   female female male  
    > Levels: female male

``` r
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("male", "female"))
sex # after re-ordering
```

    > [1] male   female female male  
    > Levels: male female

In R’s memory, these factors are represented by integers (1, 2, 3), but
are more informative than integers because factors are self describing:
`"female"`, `"male"` is more descriptive than `1`, `2`. Which one is
“male”? You wouldn’t be able to tell just from the integer data.
Factors, on the other hand, have this information built in. It is
particularly helpful when there are many levels (like the species names
in our example dataset).

### Converting factors

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, you use
`as.character(x)`.

``` r
as.character(sex)
```

In some cases, you may have to convert factors where the levels appear
as numbers (such as concentration levels or years) to a numeric vector.
For instance, in one part of your analysis the years might need to be
encoded as factors (e.g., comparing average weights across years) but in
another part of your analysis they may need to be stored as numeric
values (e.g., doing math operations on the years). This conversion from
factor to numeric is a little trickier. The `as.numeric()` function
returns the index values of the factor, not its levels, so it will
result in an entirely new (and unwanted in this case) set of numbers.
One method to avoid this is to convert factors to characters, and then
to numbers.

Another method is to use the `levels()` function. Compare:

``` r
year_fct <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))
as.numeric(year_fct)               # Wrong! And there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(year_fct)) # Works...
as.numeric(levels(year_fct))[year_fct]    # The recommended way.
```

Notice that in the `levels()` approach, three important steps occur:

  - We obtain all the factor levels using `levels(year_fct)`
  - We convert these levels to numeric values using
    `as.numeric(levels(year_fct))`
  - We then access these numeric values using the underlying integers of
    the vector `year_fct` inside the square brackets

### Renaming factors

When your data is stored as a factor, you can use the `plot()` function
to get a quick glance at the number of observations represented by each
factor level. Let’s look at the number of males and females captured
over the course of the experiment:

``` r
## bar plot of the number of females and males captured during the experiment:
plot(as.factor(surveys$sex))
```

![](fig/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

In addition to males and females, there are about 1700 individuals for
which the sex information hasn’t been recorded. Additionally, for these
individuals, there is no label to indicate that the information is
missing or undetermined. Let’s rename this label to something more
meaningful. Before doing that, we’re going to pull out the data on sex
and work with that data, so we’re not modifying the working copy of the
data frame:

``` r
sex <- factor(surveys$sex)
head(sex)
```

    > [1] M M        
    > Levels:  F M

``` r
levels(sex)
```

    > [1] ""  "F" "M"

``` r
levels(sex)[1] <- "undetermined"
levels(sex)
```

    > [1] "undetermined" "F"            "M"

``` r
head(sex)
```

    > [1] M            M            undetermined undetermined undetermined
    > [6] undetermined
    > Levels: undetermined F M

> ### Challenge

### Using `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`

In R versions previous to 4.0, when building or importing a data frame,
the columns that contain characters (i.e. text) are coerced (=
converted) into factors by default. However, since version 4.0 columns
that contain characters (i.e. text) are NOT coerced (= converted) into
factors.

Depending on what you want to do with the data, you may want to keep
these columns as `character` or you may want them to be `factor`.

`read.csv()` and `read.table()` have an argument called
`stringsAsFactors` which can be set to `FALSE` for character or `TRUE`
for factor.

In most cases, it is preferable to keep `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when
importing data and to convert as a factor only the columns that require
this data type.

``` r
## Compare the difference between our data read as `factor` vs `character`.
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(surveys)
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(surveys)
## Convert the column "plot_type" into a factor
surveys$plot_type <- factor(surveys$plot_type)
```

The automatic conversion of data type is sometimes a blessing, sometimes
an annoyance. Be aware that it exists, learn the rules, and double check
that data you import in R are of the correct type within your data
frame.

# Data Manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to
read, especially for complicated operations. **`dplyr`** is a package
for making tabular data manipulation easier. It pairs nicely with
**`tidyr`** which enables you to swiftly convert between different data
formats for plotting and analysis.

Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you do
more stuff. The functions we’ve been using so far, like `str()` or
`data.frame()`, come built into R; packages give you access to more of
them. Before you use a package for the first time you need to install it
on your machine, and then you should import it in every subsequent R
session when you need it. You should already have installed the
**`tidyverse`** package. This is an “umbrella-package” that installs
several packages useful for data analysis which work together well such
as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, **`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.

The **`tidyverse`** package tries to address 3 common issues that arise
when doing data analysis with some of the functions that come with R:

1.  The results from a base R function sometimes depend on the type of
    data.
2.  Using R expressions in a non standard way, which can be confusing
    for new learners.
3.  Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are
    not aware of.

We have seen above that when building or importing a data frame, the
columns that contain characters (i.e., text) are coerced (=converted)
into the `factor` data type. We had to set **`stringsAsFactors`** to
**`FALSE`** to avoid this hidden argument to convert our data type.

This time we will use the **`tidyverse`** package to read the data and
avoid having to set **`stringsAsFactors`** to **`FALSE`**

If we haven’t already done so, we can type
`install.packages("tidyverse")` straight into the console. In fact, it’s
better to write this in the console than in our script for any package,
as there’s no need to re-install packages every time we run the script.

Then, to load the package type:

``` r
## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
library(tidyverse)
```

## What are **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**?

The package **`dplyr`** provides easy tools for the most common data
manipulation tasks, built to work directly with data frames.

The package **`tidyr`** addresses the common problem of wanting to
reshape your data for plotting and use by different R functions.
Sometimes we want data sets where we have one row per measurement.
Sometimes we want a data frame where each measurement type has its own
column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups (e.g., a time
period, an experimental unit like a plot or a batch number). Moving back
and forth between these formats is non-trivial, and **`tidyr`** gives
you tools for this and more sophisticated data manipulation.

### Note

> An additional feature of **`dplyr`** is the ability to work directly

> queries can be conducted on that database, and only the results of the

>     .challenge}

### Getting started with Tidyverse

We’ll read in our data using the `read_csv()` function, from the
tidyverse package **`readr`**, instead of `read.csv()`.

``` r
surveys <- read_csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

You will see the message `Parsed with column specification`, followed by
each column name and its data type. When you execute `read_csv` on a
data file, it looks through the first 1000 rows of each column and
guesses the data type for each column as it reads it into R. For
example, in this dataset, `read_csv` reads `weight` as `col_double` (a
numeric data type), and `species` as `col_character`. You have the
option to specify the data type for a column manually by using the
`col_types` argument in `read_csv`.

``` r
## inspect the data
str(surveys)
```

``` r
## preview the data
View(surveys)
```

Notice that the class of the data is now `tbl_df`

This is referred to as a “tibble”. Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors
of the data frame objects we introduced in the previous lesson. The data
structure is very similar to a data frame. For our purposes the only
differences are that:

1.  In addition to displaying the data type of each column under its
    name, it only prints the first few rows of data and only as many
    columns as fit on one screen.
2.  Columns of class `character` are never converted into factors.

## Managing Data with dplyr

We’re going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

  - `select()`: subset columns
  - `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
  - `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other
    columns
  - `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped
    data
  - `arrange()`: sort results
  - `count()`: count discrete values

{: .challenge}

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument to
this function is the data frame (`surveys`), and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.

``` r
select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)
```

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a “-” in front of the
variable to exclude it.

``` r
select(surveys, -record_id, -species_id)
```

This will select all the variables in `surveys` except `record_id` and
`species_id`.

To choose rows based on a specific criterion, use `filter()`:

``` r
filter(surveys, year == 1995)
```

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use that
as input to the next function, like this:

``` r
surveys2 <- filter(surveys, weight < 5)
surveys_sml <- select(surveys2, species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects
that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be
hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like
this:

``` r
surveys_sml <- select(filter(surveys, weight < 5), species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are
nested, as R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case,
filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take
the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is
useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset. Pipes in R
look like `%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package,
installed automatically with **`dplyr`**.

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
```

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `surveys` dataset first
through `filter()` to keep rows where `weight` is less than 5, then
through `select()` to keep only the `species_id`, `sex`, and `weight`
columns. Since `%>%` takes the object on its left and passes it as the
first argument to the function on its right, we don’t need to explicitly
include the data frame as an argument to the `filter()` and `select()`
functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word “then”. For
instance, in the above example, we took the data frame `surveys`, *then*
we `filter`-ed for rows with `weight < 5`, *then* we `select`ed columns
`species_id`, `sex`, and `weight`. The **`dplyr`** functions by
themselves are somewhat simple, but by combining them into linear
workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more complex manipulations of
data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data,
we can assign it a new name:

``` r
surveys_sml <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)

surveys_sml
```

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

>  
{: .challenge}

### Mutate

Frequently you’ll want to create new columns based on the values in
existing columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the
ratio of values in two columns. For this we’ll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:

``` r
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000)
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column
within the same call of `mutate()`:

``` r
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000,
         weight_lb = weight_kg * 2.2)
```

If this runs off your screen and you just want to see the first few
rows, you can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data. (Pipes work
with non-**`dplyr`** functions, too, as long as the **`dplyr`** or
`magrittr` package is loaded).

``` r
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

The first few rows of the output are full of `NA`s, so if we wanted to
remove those we could insert a `filter()` in the chain:

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

`is.na()` is a function that determines whether something is an `NA`.
The `!` symbol negates the result, so we’re asking for every row where
weight *is not* an `NA`.

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the `summarize()` function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the
*split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some
analysis to each group, and then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes
this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.

#### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses
each group into a single-row summary of that group. `group_by()` takes
as arguments the column names that contain the **categorical** variables
for which you want to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute
the mean `weight` by sex:

``` r
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

You may also have noticed that the output from these calls doesn’t run
off the screen anymore. It’s one of the advantages of `tbl_df` over data
frame.

You can also group by multiple columns:

``` r
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  tail()
```

Here, we used `tail()` to look at the last six rows of our summary.
Before, we had used `head()` to look at the first six rows. We can see
that the `sex` column contains `NA` values because some animals had
escaped before their sex and body weights could be determined. The
resulting `mean_weight` column does not contain `NA` but `NaN` (which
refers to “Not a Number”) because `mean()` was called on a vector of
`NA` values while at the same time setting `na.rm = TRUE`. To avoid
this, we can remove the missing values for weight before we attempt to
calculate the summary statistics on weight. Because the missing values
are removed first, we can omit `na.rm = TRUE` when computing the mean:

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

Here, again, the output from these calls doesn’t run off the screen
anymore. If you want to display more data, you can use the `print()`
function at the end of your chain with the argument `n` specifying the
number of rows to display:

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  print(n = 15)
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at
the same time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance,
we could add a column indicating the minimum weight for each species for
each sex:

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))
```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the
values. For instance, we can sort on `min_weight` to put the lighter
species first:

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(min_weight)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we
want to sort the results by decreasing order of mean weight:

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_weight))
```

#### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations
found for each factor or combination of factors. For this task,
**`dplyr`** provides `count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the
number of rows of data for each sex, we would do:

``` r
surveys %>%
    count(sex)
```

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we’ve already seen:
grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of
observations in that group. In other words, `surveys %>% count()` is
equivalent to:

``` r
surveys %>%
    group_by(sex) %>%
    summarize(count = n())
```

For convenience, `count()` provides the `sort` argument:

``` r
surveys %>%
    count(sex, sort = TRUE)
```

Previous example shows the use of `count()` to count the number of
rows/observations for *one* factor (i.e., `sex`). If we wanted to count
*combination of factors*, such as `sex` and `species`, we would specify
the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:

``` r
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species)
```

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table
according to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison.
For instance, we might want to arrange the table above in (i) an
alphabetical order of the levels of the species and (ii) in descending
order of the count:

``` r
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species) %>%
  arrange(species, desc(n))
```

From the table above, we may learn that, for instance, there are 75
observations of the *albigula* species that are not specified for its
sex (i.e. `NA`).

### Reshaping with pivot\_wider and pivot\_longer

In the [spreadsheet
lesson](https://southampton-rsg.github.io/spreadsheets-data-organisation-and-management/01-format-data/index.html),
we discussed how to structure our data leading to the four rules
defining a tidy dataset:

1.  Each variable has its own column
2.  Each observation has its own row
3.  Each value must have its own cell
4.  Each type of observational unit forms a table

Here we examine the fourth rule: Each type of observational unit forms a
table.

In `surveys`, the rows of `surveys` contain the values of variables
associated with each record (the unit), values such as the weight or sex
of each animal associated with each record. What if instead of comparing
records, we wanted to compare the different mean weight of each genus
between plots? (Ignoring `plot_type` for simplicity).

We’d need to create a new table where each row (the unit) is comprised
of values of variables associated with each plot. In practical terms
this means the values in `genus` would become the names of column
variables and the cells would contain the values of the mean weight
observed on each plot.

Having created a new table, it is therefore straightforward to explore
the relationship between the weight of different genera within, and
between, the plots. The key point here is that we are still following a
tidy data structure, but we have **reshaped** the data according to the
observations of interest: average genus weight per plot instead of
recordings per date.

The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into
values of a variable.

We can do both these of transformations with two `tidyr` functions,
`pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`.

#### Pivot\_wider

`pivot_wider()` takes three principal arguments:

1.  the data
2.  *names\_from* indicates which column (or columns) to get the name of
    the output column from
3.  *values\_from* indicates which column (or columns) to get the cell
    values from

Further arguments include *values\_fill* which, if set, fills in missing
values with the value provided.

Let’s use `pivot_wider()` to transform surveys to find the mean weight
of each genus in each plot over the entire survey period. We use
`filter()`, `group_by()` and `summarize()` to filter our observations
and variables of interest, and create a new variable for the
`mean_weight`.

``` r
surveys_gw <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(plot_id, genus) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))

str(surveys_gw)
```

This yields `surveys_gw` where the observations for each plot are spread
across multiple rows, 196 observations of 3 variables. Using
`pivot_wider()` with *names\_from* `genus` and *values\_from*
`mean_weight` this becomes 24 observations of 11 variables, one row for
each plot.

``` r
surveys_wide<- surveys_gw %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = genus, values_from = mean_weight)

str(surveys_wide)
```

![](fig/pivot_wider.png)

We could now plot comparisons between the weight of genera in different
plots, although we may wish to fill in the missing values first.

``` r
surveys_gw %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = genus, values_from = mean_weight, values_fill = 0) %>%
  head()
```

#### Pivot\_longer

The opposing situation could occur if we had been provided with data in
the form of `surveys_wide`, where the genus names are column names, but
we wish to treat them as values of a genus variable instead.

In this situation we are gathering the column names and turning them
into a pair of new variables. One variable represents the column names
as values, and the other variable contains the values previously
associated with the column names.

`pivot_longer()` takes four principal arguments:

1.  the data
2.  *cols* indicates the columns to pivot into longer format (or those
    not to pivot)
3.  *names\_to* indicates the name of the column to create from the data
    stored in the column names of data.
4.  *values\_to* indicates the name of the column to create from the
    data stored in cell values.

To recreate `surveys_gw` from `surveys_wide` we would set *names\_to*
`genus` and *values\_to* `mean_weight` and use all columns except
`plot_id` for the key variable. Here we exclude `plot_id` from being
pivoted.

``` r
surveys_long <- surveys_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -plot_id, names_to = "genus", values_to = "mean_weight")

str(surveys_long)
```

![](fig/pivot_longer.png)

Note that now the `NA` genera are included in the new pivot\_longer
format. Using pivot\_wider and then pivot\_longer can be a useful way to
balance out a dataset so every replicate has the same composition.

We could also have used a specification for what columns to include.
This can be useful if you have a large number of identifying columns,
and it’s easier to specify what to pivot than what to leave alone. And
if the columns are directly adjacent, we don’t even need to list them
all out - just use the `:` operator\!

``` r
surveys_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Baiomys:Spermophilus, names_to = "genus", values_to = "mean_weight") %>%
  head()
```

# Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to extract information
from or summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data
sets to share them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R,
there is a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data
frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder, `data`,
in our working directory that will store this generated dataset. We
don’t want to write generated datasets in the same directory as our
raw data. It’s good practice to keep them separate. The `data_raw`
folder should only contain the raw, unaltered data, and should be left
alone to make sure we don’t delete or modify it. In contrast, our script
will generate the contents of the `data` directory, so even if the files
it contains are deleted, we can always re-generate them.

In preparation for our next lesson on plotting, we are going to prepare
a cleaned up version of the data set that doesn’t include any missing
data.

Let’s start by removing observations of animals for which `weight` and
`hindfoot_length` are missing, or the `sex` has not been determined:

``` r
surveys_complete <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight),           # remove missing weight
         !is.na(hindfoot_length),  # remove missing hindfoot_length
         !is.na(sex))                # remove missing sex
```

Because we are interested in plotting how species abundances have
changed through time, we are also going to remove observations for rare
species (i.e., that have been observed less than 50 times). We will do
this in two steps: first we are going to create a data set that counts
how often each species has been observed, and filter out the rare
species; then, we will extract only the observations for these more
common species:

``` r
## Extract the most common species_id
species_counts <- surveys_complete %>%
    count(species_id) %>%
    filter(n >= 50)

## Only keep the most common species
surveys_complete <- surveys_complete %>%
  filter(species_id %in% species_counts$species_id)
```

To make sure that everyone has the same data set, check that
`surveys_complete` has 30463 rows and 13 columns by typing
`dim(surveys_complete)`.

Now that our data set is ready, we can save it as a CSV file in our
`data` folder.

``` r
write_csv(surveys_complete, file = "data/surveys_complete.csv")
```
