To start with we will focus on the first three learning objectives and
get your working environment set up.

## What is R? What is RStudio?

The term “`R`” is used to refer to both the programming language and the
software that interprets the scripts written using it.

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com) is a very popular way to not only write R
scripts but also to interact with the R software. To function correctly,
RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your
computer.

## Why learn R?

### R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that’s a good thing

The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with
R, the results of your analysis do not rely on a succession of pointing
and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands, and that’s a
good thing\! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected
more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked in which
order to obtain your results; you just have to run your script again.

Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear,
and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you
feedback and spot mistakes.

Working with scripts enables a deeper understanding of what you are
doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods
you use.

### R code is great for reproducibility

Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can
obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same
analysis.

An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to
be reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these
requirements.

### R is interdisciplinary and extensible

With 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities,
R provides a framework to best suit the analytical framework you need to
analyze your data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS,
time series, population genetics, and a lot more.

### R works on data of all shapes and sizes

The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset.
Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won’t make
much difference to you.

R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures
and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical
factors convenient.

R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats,
on your computer or on the web.

### R produces high-quality graphics

The plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust
any aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from
your data.

### R has a large and welcoming community

Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you
through mailing lists and websites such as [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), or on the [RStudio
community](https://community.rstudio.com/).

## Knowing your way around RStudio

Let’s start by learning about [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which
is an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working
with R.

We will use RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our
computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize
the plots we will generate.

![RStudio interface screenshot. Clockwise from top left: Source,
Environment/History, Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer,
Console.](fig/rstudio-screenshot.png)

RStudio is divided into 4 “Panes”: the **Source** for your scripts and
documents (top-left, in the default layout), your
**Environment/History** (top-right) which shows all the objects in your
working space (Environment) and your command history (History), your
**Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** (bottom-right), and the R
**Console** (bottom-left). The placement of these panes and their
content can be customized (see menu, Tools -\> Global Options -\> Pane
Layout).

## Getting set up

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
self-contained in a single folder, called the **working directory**. All
of the scripts within this folder can then use *relative paths* to files
that indicate where inside the project a file is located. Working this
way makes it a lot easier to move your project around on your computer
and share it with others.

RStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its
“Projects” interface, which not only creates a working directory for
you, but also remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate
to it). Go through the steps for creating an “R Project” for this
tutorial below.

1.  Start RStudio.
2.  Under the `File` menu, click on `New Project`. Choose `New
    Directory`, then `New Project`.
3.  Enter a name for this new folder (or “directory”), and choose a
    convenient location for it. This will be your **working directory**
    for the rest of the day (e.g., `~/data-carpentry`).
4.  Click on `Create Project`.
5.  (Optional) Set Preferences to ‘Never’ save workspace in RStudio.

A workspace is your current working environment in R which includes any
user-defined object. By default, all of these objects will be saved, and
automatically loaded, when you reopen your project. Saving a workspace
to `.RData` can be cumbersome, especially if you are working with larger
datasets, and it can lead to hard to debug errors by having objects in
memory you forgot you had. To turn that off, go to Tools –\> ‘Global
Options’ and select the ‘Never’ option for ‘Save workspace to .RData’ on
exit.’

‘Never’](fig/rstudio-preferences.png)

### Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will make it
easy to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful
when you have multiple projects. In general, you may create directories
(folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and **documents**.

  - **`data_raw/` & `data/`** Use these folders to store raw data and
    intermediate datasets you may create for the need of a particular
    analysis. For the sake of transparency and
    [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance), you should
    *always* keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of
    your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with
    scripts, rather than manually) as possible. Separating raw data from
    processed data is also a good idea. For example, you could have
    files `data_raw/tree_survey.plot1.txt` and `...plot2.txt` kept
    separate from a `data/tree.survey.csv` file generated by the
    `scripts/01.preprocess.tree_survey.R` script.
  - **`documents/`** This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts, and
    other text.
  - **`scripts/`** This would be the location to keep your R scripts for
    different analyses or plotting, and potentially a separate folder
    for your functions (more on that later).
  - **Additional (sub)directories** depending on your project needs.

For this workshop, we will need a `data_raw/` folder to store our raw
data, and we will use `data/` for when we learn how to export data as
CSV files, and a `fig/` folder for the figures that we will save.

  - Under the `Files` tab on the right of the screen, click on `New
    Folder` and create a folder named `data_raw` within your newly
    created working directory (e.g., `~/data-carpentry/`).
    (Alternatively, type `dir.create("data_raw")` at your R console.)
    Repeat these operations to create a `data` and a `fig` folder.

We are going to keep the script in the root of our working directory
because we are only going to use one file and it will make things
easier. Create this using the new file button in the top left hand
corner and select R Script, the hit save and name it
`data-carpentry-script`.

Your working directory should now look like this:
![](fig/r-starting-how-it-should-look-like.png)

{: .challenge}


![](fig/file_structure_diagram.png)

### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the
place from where R will be looking for and saving the files. When using
R projects the working directory has a .Rproj file in it. When you write
code for your project, it should refer to files in relation to the root
of your working directory and only need files within this structure.

Using RStudio projects makes this easy and ensures that your working
directory is set properly. If you need to check it, you can use
`getwd()`. If for some reason your working directory is not what it
should be, you can change it in the RStudio interface by navigating in
the file browser where your working directory should be, and clicking on
the blue gear icon “More”, and select “Set As Working Directory”.
Alternatively you can use `setwd("/path/to/working/directory")` to reset
your working directory. However, your scripts should not include this
line because it will fail on someone else’s computer.

## Interacting with R

The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the
computer to follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those
instructions. We write, or *code*, instructions in R because it is a
common language that both the computer and we can understand. We call
the instructions *commands* and we tell the computer to follow the
instructions by *executing* (also called *running*) those commands.

There are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or
by using script files (plain text files that contain your code). The
console pane (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where
commands written in the R language can be typed and executed immediately
by the computer. It is also where the results will be shown for commands
that have been executed. You can type commands directly into the console
and press `Enter` to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten
when you close the session.

Because we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better
to type the commands we want in the script editor, and save the script.
This way, there is a complete record of what we did, and anyone
(including our future selves\!) can replicate the results on their
computer.

RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor
by using the <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd> shortcut (on Macs,
<kbd>`Cmd`</kbd> + <kbd>`Return`</kbd> will work, too). The command on
the current line in the script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the
commands in the currently selected text will be sent to the console and
executed when you press <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>. You can
find other keyboard shortcuts in this [RStudio cheatsheet about the
RStudio
IDE](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf).

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If
it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script
editor using <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd>), R will try to
execute it, and when ready, will show the results and come back with a
new `>` prompt to wait for new commands.

If R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn’t
complete yet, the console will show a `+` prompt. It means that you
haven’t finished entering a complete command. This is because you have
not ‘closed’ a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you don’t have the same
number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same number of
opening and closing quotation marks. When this happens, and you thought
you finished typing your command, click inside the console window and
press <kbd>`Esc`</kbd>; this will cancel the incomplete command and
return you to the `>` prompt.

## Seeking help

### Use the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more information on R functions

![RStudio help interface.](fig/rstudiohelp.png)

One of the fastest ways to get help, is to use the RStudio help
interface. This panel by default can be found at the lower right hand
panel of RStudio. As seen in the screenshot, by typing the word “Mean”,
RStudio tries to also give a number of suggestions that you might be
interested in. The description is then shown in the display window.

### I know the name of the function I want to use, but I’m not sure how to use it

If you need help with a specific function, let’s say `lm()`, you can
type:

``` r
?lm
```

### I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don’t know which one…

If you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use
the `help.search()` function, which is called by the double question
mark `??`. However, this only looks through the installed packages for
help pages with a match to your search request

``` r
??kruskal
```

If you can’t find what you are looking for, you can use the
[rdocumentation.org](https://www.rdocumentation.org) website that
searches through the help files across all packages available.

Finally, a generic Google or internet search “R \<task\>” will often
either send you to the appropriate package documentation or a helpful
forum where someone else has already asked your question.

### I am stuck… I get an error message that I don’t understand

Start by googling the error message. However, this doesn’t always work
very well because often, package developers rely on the error catching
provided by R. You end up with general error messages that might not be
very helpful to diagnose a problem (e.g. “subscript out of bounds”). If
the message is very generic, you might also include the name of the
function or package you’re using in your query.

### Where to ask for help?

  - The other people here; you might also be interested in organizing
    regular meetings following the workshop to keep learning from each
    other.
  - Your friendly colleagues: if you know someone with more experience
    than you, they might be able and willing to help you.
  - [Stack Overflow’s
    `[r]`-tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r?tab=Votes):
    Most questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to
    use the right words in the search to find the answers. If your
    question hasn’t been answered before and is well crafted, chances
    are you will get an answer in less than 5 min. Remember to follow
    their guidelines on [how to ask a good
    question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

Now that we have a working environment set up we can start on the basics
of R.

## Creating objects in R

You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:

``` r
3 + 5
```

    > [1] 8

``` r
12 / 7
```

    > [1] 1.714286

{: .challenge}

However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign *values*
to *objects*.

A *value* is a piece of information that we want to store and retrieve
at some later time, i.e. a number, a sequence of numbers, or even
collections of data, for now we will start with numbers and later move
onto collections of numbers which in R are called *vectors*.

An *object* is programming speak for a thing with known properties. Lets
consider an example that we would all be familiar with before jumping
into some R.

I tell you that I have a *car*, in this case the car is the *object*.
Without any further information you instinctively know that the *object*
called *car* has several *attributes*. For example, *colour*, *make*,
*model*, *numberplate*. You can use this predefined model to ask
sensible questions. For example if you ask me, what model the car is (or
model(*car*)) I can tell you ‘Corsa’. However, if you were to ask me
breed(*car*) this would be a nonsense question to which I would not be
able to answer, where as breed(*pet*) then I could tell you ‘sheepdog’.

{: .challenge}

In this tutorial we will use the predefined R objects for vectors and
numerical values. We will see that these are much simpler than the
linguistic examples above, and we learn the sort of *attributes* we
expect them to have and how to inspect an object to tell us its set of
*attributes*.

To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the
assignment operator `<-`, and the value we want to give it:

``` r
weight_kg <- 55
```

`<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to
objects on the left. So, after executing `weight_kg <- 55`, the value of
`weight_kg` is `55`. The arrow can be read as 55 **goes into**
`weight_kg`.

### What is my object?

Once an *object* is created we can get information about that object in
the Environment tab in the top right of RStudio. For example,
‘weight\_kg’ has the type numeric length 1 and value 55. Make sure to
keep an eye on the other values that appear here when using RStudio to
understand what objects you have. This tab is great for small variables,
when inspecting larger or more complicated objects it is better to use
more advanced methods we will cover later on.

### How do I name my objects?

Objects can be given any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or
`subject_id`. You want your object names to be explicit and not too
long. They cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid, but `x2` is).
R is case sensitive (e.g., `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`).
There are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of
fundamental functions in R (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, see
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)
for a complete list). In general, even if it’s allowed, it’s best to not
use other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`,
`weights`). If in doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in
use. It’s also best to avoid dots (`.`) within names. Many function
names in R itself have them and dots also have a special meaning
(methods) in R and other programming languages. To avoid confusion,
don’t include dots in names. It is also recommended to use nouns for
object names, and verbs for function names. It’s important to be
consistent in the styling of your code (where you put spaces, how you
name objects, etc.). Using a consistent coding style makes your code
clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. In R, three
popular style guides are
[Google’s](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml), [Jean
Fan’s](https://jef.works/R-style-guide/) and the
[tidyverse’s](https://style.tidyverse.org/). The tidyverse’s is very
comprehensive and may seem overwhelming at first. You can install the
[**`lintr`**](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package to
automatically check for issues in the styling of your code.

> ### Objects vs. variables
> 
> What are known as `objects` in `R` are known as `variables` in many
> other programming languages. Depending on the context, `object` and
> `variable` can have drastically different meanings. However, in this
> lesson, the two words are used synonymously. For more information see:
> <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects>

When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can
force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object
name:

``` r
weight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything
(weight_kg <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`
weight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object
```

Now that R has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For
instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in
pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):

``` r
2.2 * weight_kg
```

    > [1] 121

We can also change an object’s value by assigning it a new one:

``` r
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

    > [1] 126.5

This means that assigning a value to one object does not change the
values of other objects. For example, let’s store the animal’s weight in
pounds in a new object, `weight_lb`:

``` r
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
```

and then change `weight_kg` to 100.

``` r
weight_kg <- 100
```

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`?
126.5 or 220?

### Comments

The comment character in R is `#`, anything to the right of a `#` in a
script will be ignored by R. It is best practice to leave notes and
explanations in your scripts. So that others can understand your code
and that you can remember what each line does.

> age  <- age - 20        # age?
> mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?

{: .challenge}


### Functions and their arguments

Functions automate sets of commands including operations assignments,
etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be made available by
importing R *packages* (more on that later). A function usually takes
one or more inputs called *arguments*. Functions often (but not always)
return a *value*. A typical example would be the function `sqrt()`. The
input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in fact,
the output) is the square root of that number. Executing a function
(‘running it’) is called *calling* the function. An example of a
function call is:

``` r
weight_kg <- sqrt(10)
```

Here, the value of `ten` is given to the `sqrt()` function, the `sqrt()`
function calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then
assigned to the object `weight_kg`. This function is very simple,
because it takes just one argument.

The return ‘value’ of a function need not be numerical (like that of
`sqrt()`), and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a
set of things, or even a dataset. We’ll see that when we read data files
into R.

Arguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other
objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must
be looked up in the documentation (see below). Some functions take
arguments which may either be specified by the user, or, if left out,
take on a *default* value: these are called *options*. Options are
typically used to alter the way the function operates, such as whether
it ignores ‘bad values’, or what symbol to use in a plot. However, if
you want something specific, you can specify a value of your choice
which will be used instead of the default.

Let’s try a function that can take multiple arguments: `round()`.

``` r
round(3.14159)
```

    > [1] 3

Here, we’ve called `round()` with just one argument, `3.14159`, and it
has returned the value `3`. That’s because the default is to round to
the nearest whole number. If we want more digits we can see how to do
that by getting information about the `round` function. We can use
`args(round)` to find what arguments it takes, or look at the help for
this function using `?round`.

``` r
args(round)
```

    > function (x, digits = 0) 
    > NULL

``` r
?round
```

We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can type `digits
= 2` or however many we want.

``` r
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
```

## Vectors and data types

A vector is the most common and basic data type in R. A vector is
composed by a series of values, which can be either numbers or
characters. We can assign a series of values to a vector using the `c()`
function. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and
assign it to a new object `weight_g`:

``` r
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g
```

    > [1] 50 60 65 82

A vector can also contain characters:

``` r
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
animals
```

    > [1] "mouse" "rat"   "dog"

The quotes around “mouse”, “rat”, etc. are essential here to tell R that
these are characters and not objects.

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a
vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular
vector:

``` r
length(weight_g)
```

    > [1] 4

``` r
length(animals)
```

    > [1] 3

An important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the
same type of data. The function `class()` indicates what kind of object
you are working with:

``` r
class(weight_g)
```

    > [1] "numeric"

``` r
class(animals)
```

    > [1] "character"

The function `str()` provides an overview of the structure of an object
and its elements. It is a useful function when working with large and
complex objects:

``` r
str(weight_g)
```

    >  num [1:4] 50 60 65 82

``` r
str(animals)
```

    >  chr [1:3] "mouse" "rat" "dog"

You can use the `c()` function to add other elements to your vector:

``` r
weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector
weight_g
```

    > [1] 30 50 60 65 82 90

In the first line, we take the original vector `weight_g`, add the value
`90` to the end of it, and save the result back into `weight_g`. Then we
add the value `30` to the beginning, again saving the result back into
`weight_g`.

We can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a
dataset. As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are
collecting or calculating.

An **atomic vector** is the simplest R **data type** and is a linear
vector of a single type. The 6 **atomic vector** types are:

  - `"character"` for text
  - `"numeric"` or `"double"` for non-interger numbers
  - `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)
  - `"integer"` for integer numbers (e.g., `2L`, the `L` indicates to R
    that it’s an integer)
  - `"complex"` to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary
    parts (e.g., `1 + 4i`) and that’s all we’re going to say about them
  - `"raw"` for bitstreams that we won’t discuss further

You can check the type of your vector using the `typeof()` function and
inputting your vector as the argument.

Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that R uses. Other
important ones are lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames
(`data.frame`), factors (`factor`) and arrays (`array`).

## Subsetting vectors

If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must
provide one or several indices in square brackets. For instance:

``` r
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
```

    > [1] "rat"

``` r
animals[c(3, 2)]
```

    > [1] "dog" "rat"

We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements
than the original one:

``` r
more_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_animals
```

    > [1] "mouse" "rat"   "dog"   "rat"   "mouse" "cat"

### Conditional subsetting

Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. `TRUE`
will select the element with the same index, while `FALSE` will not:

``` r
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

    > [1] 21 54 55

Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the
output of other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted
to select only the values above 50:

``` r
weight_g > 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition
```

    > [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE

``` r
## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g > 50]
```

    > [1] 54 55

You can combine multiple tests using `&` (both conditions are true, AND)
or `|` (at least one of the conditions is true, OR):

``` r
weight_g[weight_g > 30 & weight_g < 50]
```

    > [1] 34 39

``` r
weight_g[weight_g <= 30 | weight_g == 55]
```

    > [1] 21 55

``` r
weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21]
```

    > numeric(0)

Here, `>` for “greater than”, `<` stands for “less than”, `<=` for “less
than or equal to”, and `==` for “equal to”. The double equal sign `==`
is a test for numerical equality between the left and right hand sides,
and should not be confused with the single `=` sign, which performs
variable assignment (similar to `<-`).

A common task is to search for certain strings in a vector. One could
use the “or” operator `|` to test for equality to multiple values, but
this can quickly become tedious. The function `%in%` allows you to test
if any of the elements of a search vector are found:

``` r
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"] # returns both rat and cat
```

    > [1] "rat" "cat"

``` r
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")
```

    > [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE

``` r
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat")]
```

    > [1] "rat" "dog" "cat"

## Missing data

As R was designed to analyze datasets it includes the concept of missing
data. Missing data are represented in vectors as `NA`.

When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the
data you are working with include missing values. This feature makes it
harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data.
You can add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to calculate the result while
ignoring the missing values.

``` r
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar
with the functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See
below for examples.

``` r
## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]

## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed.
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
na.omit(heights)

## Extract those elements which are complete cases.
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
```

Recall that you can use the `typeof()` function to find the type of your
atomic vector.

We have now learnt enough of the basics of R to be able to use R in
place of spreadsheets. As the previous lessons will have shown you
spreadsheets can be good for small amounts of data that can be managed
*by hand*. With R will will be able to load large sets of data and
create readable, reliable, and reproducible data analysis scripts.

## Presentation of the Survey Data

We are investigating the animal species diversity and weights found
within plots at our study site. The dataset is stored as a comma
separated value (CSV) file. Each row holds information for a single
animal, and the columns represent:

| Column           | Description                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| record\_id       | Unique id for the observation      |
| month            | month of observation               |
| day              | day of observation                 |
| year             | year of observation                |
| plot\_id         | ID of a particular plot            |
| species\_id      | 2-letter code                      |
| sex              | sex of animal (“M”, “F”)           |
| hindfoot\_length | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      |
| genus            | genus of animal                    |
| species          | species of animal                  |
| taxon            | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit |
| plot\_type       | type of plot                       |

We are going to use the R function `download.file()` to download the CSV
file that contains the survey data from Figshare. Lets investigate the
`download.file()` function.

In the R console type `?download.file` and then look at the help view
that will open on the bottom right. We can see a description and a list
of arguments. We need the first two, `url` and `destfile`.

>   - url: A character string giving a source URL for the data we use
>     “<https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169>”.
>   - destfile: A character string (or *vector*) denoting the
>     destination and name for the downloaded data we use
>     “data\_raw/portal\_data\_joined.csv”.

You’ll need the folder on your machine called “data\_raw” in your
working envronment which we made earlier. So this command downloads a
file from Figshare, names it “portal\_data\_joined.csv” and adds it to
the preexisting folder named “data\_raw”.

``` r
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

You are now ready to load the data we use `read.csv()` to load the
content of the CSV file as an object of class `data.frame`, we can again
use `?` and find the arguments of `?read.csv`. This time we just need
the first argument `file` which we give the location of the file
i.e. `destfile` from before.

### Note

> It would be worth your time looking over all the arguments of
> `read.csv` as reading in CSV files will likely be a useful skill
> during your research.

``` r
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

This statement doesn’t produce any output because, as you might recall,
assignments don’t display anything. If we want to check that our data
has been loaded, we can check the environment pane in RStudio.

To check the top (the first 6 lines) of this data frame we use the
function `head()`:

``` r
head(surveys)
```

## What are data frames?

Data frames are a data structure for most tabular data, and what we use
for statistics and plotting.

A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are
generated by the functions `read.csv()` or `read.table()`; in other
words, when importing spreadsheets or other tabulated data.

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table
where the columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because
columns are vectors, each column must contain a single type of data
(e.g., characters, integers, factors). For example, here is a figure
depicting a data frame comprising a numeric, a character, and a logical
vector.

![](fig/data-frame.svg)

We can see this when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame
with the function `str()`:

``` r
str(surveys)
```

## Inspecting `data.frame` Objects

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to
check the content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a
non-exhaustive list of functions to get a sense of the content/structure
of the data. Let’s try them out\!

  - Size:
      - `dim(surveys)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the
        first element, and the number of columns as the second element
        (the **dim**ensions of the object)
      - `nrow(surveys)` - returns the number of rows
      - `ncol(surveys)` - returns the number of columns
  - Content:
      - `head(surveys)` - shows the first 6 rows
      - `tail(surveys)` - shows the last 6 rows
  - Names:
      - `names(surveys)` - returns the column names (synonym of
        `colnames()` for `data.frame` objects)
      - `rownames(surveys)` - returns the row names
  - Summary:
      - `str(surveys)` - structure of the object and information about
        the class, length and content of each column
      - `summary(surveys)` - summary statistics for each column

## Indexing and subsetting data frames

Our survey data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions), if we
want to extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the
“coordinates” we want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by
column numbers. However, note that different ways of specifying these
coordinates lead to results with different classes.

``` r
# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[1, 1]
# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
surveys[1, 6]
# first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[, 1]
# first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[1]
# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
surveys[1:3, 7]
# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[3, ]
# equivalent to head_surveys <- head(surveys)
head_surveys <- surveys[1:6, ]
```

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in
increasing or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the “`-`”
sign:

``` r
surveys[, -1]          # The whole data frame, except the first column
surveys[-(7:34786), ] # Equivalent to head(surveys)
```

Data frames can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but
also by calling their column names directly:

``` r
surveys["species_id"]       # Result is a data.frame
surveys[, "species_id"]     # Result is a vector
surveys[["species_id"]]     # Result is a vector
surveys$species_id          # Result is a vector
```

In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and
correct names of the columns.

## Formatting Dates

One of the most common issues that new (and experienced\!) R users have
is converting date and time information into a variable that is
appropriate and usable during analyses. As a reminder from earlier in
this lesson, the best practice for dealing with date data is to ensure
that each component of your date is stored as a separate variable. Using
`str()`, We can confirm that our data frame has a separate column for
day, month, and year, and that each contains integer values.

``` r
str(surveys)
```

We are going to use the `ymd()` function from the package
**`lubridate`** (which belongs to the **`tidyverse`**; learn more
[here](https://www.tidyverse.org/)). When you load the **`tidyverse`**
(`library("tidyverse")`), the core packages get loaded. **`lubridate`**
however does not belong to the core tidyverse, so you have to load it
explicitly with `library(lubridate)`

Start by loading the required package:

``` r
library("lubridate")
```

`ymd()` takes a vector representing year, month, and day, and converts
it to a `Date` vector. `Date` is a class of data recognized by R as
being a date and can be manipulated as such. The argument that the
function requires is a character vector formatted as “YYYY-MM-DD”.

Let’s create a date object and inspect the structure:

``` r
my_date <- ymd("2015-01-01")
str(my_date)
```

Now let’s paste the year, month, and day separately - we get the same
result:

``` r
# sep indicates the character to use to separate each component
my_date <- ymd(paste("2015", "1", "1", sep = "-"))
str(my_date)
```

We can apply this operation to each row of the surveys dataset. We
extract the vectors `surveys$year`, `surveys$month`, and `surveys$day`.
Using `paste()` we can combine these vectors into a new vector for
character dates.

``` r
dates_char_vec <- paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-")
```

This character vector can be used as the argument for `ymd()`:

``` r
date_vec <- ymd(dates_char_vec)
```

Something went wrong lets use `summary` to inspect `date_vec`:

``` r
summary(date_vec)
```

    >         Min.      1st Qu.       Median         Mean      3rd Qu.         Max. 
    > "1977-07-16" "1984-03-12" "1990-07-22" "1990-12-15" "1997-07-29" "2002-12-31" 
    >         NA's 
    >        "129"

Some dates have missing values. Let’s investigate where they are coming
from.

``` r
missing_dates_vec <- dates_char_vec[is.na(date_vec)]
head(missing_dates_vec)
```

    > [1] "2000-9-31" "2000-4-31" "2000-4-31" "2000-4-31" "2000-4-31" "2000-9-31"

or

``` r
missing_dates_tab <- surveys[is.na(date_vec), c("year", "month", "day")]
head(missing_dates_tab)
```

    >      year month day
    > 3144 2000     9  31
    > 3817 2000     4  31
    > 3818 2000     4  31
    > 3819 2000     4  31
    > 3820 2000     4  31
    > 3856 2000     9  31

Why did these dates fail to parse? If you had to use these data for your
analyses, how would you deal with this situation?

### Note

The resulting `Date` vector `date_vec` can be added to `surveys` as a
new column called `date`:

``` r
surveys$date <- date_vec
str(surveys) # notice the new column, with 'date' as the class
```

    > 'data.frame': 34786 obs. of  14 variables:
    >  $ record_id      : int  1 72 224 266 349 363 435 506 588 661 ...
    >  $ month          : int  7 8 9 10 11 11 12 1 2 3 ...

    >  $ year           : int  1977 1977 1977 1977 1977 1977 1977 1978 1978 1978 ...

    >  $ species_id     : chr  "NL" "NL" "NL" "NL" ...
    >  $ sex            : chr  "M" "M" "" "" ...
    >  $ hindfoot_length: int  32 31 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
    >  $ weight         : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 218 NA ...
    >  $ genus          : chr  "Neotoma" "Neotoma" "Neotoma" "Neotoma" ...
    >  $ species        : chr  "albigula" "albigula" "albigula" "albigula" ...
    >  $ taxa           : chr  "Rodent" "Rodent" "Rodent" "Rodent" ...
    >  $ plot_type      : chr  "Control" "Control" "Control" "Control" ...
    >  $ date           : Date, format: "1977-07-16" "1977-08-19" ...

### Note

> For completeness sake it is worth noting that the above could be
> achieved in one line. `surveys$date <- ymd(paste(surveys$year,

You have now completed all the day one learning objectives. It is very
common to make mistakes in programming languages, identifying and
solving `debugging` these mistakes makes up a large part of the
programming skill-set. Becoming familiar with the basics we have covered
today and the inspection tools e.g. `summary()`, `ls()`, `str()` will
set you on a path to being a confident R programmer.
